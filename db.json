      "content": "<p>By now, you are probably familiar with one or more programming languages. <strong>But have you ever wondered how you could create your own programming language?</strong> And by that, I mean:</p><blockquote><p><i>A programming language is any set of rules that convert strings to various kinds of machine code output.</i></p></blockquote><p>In short, a programming language is just a set of predefined rules. And to make them useful, you need something that understands those rules. And those things are <i>compilers</i>, <i>interpreters</i>, etc. So we can simply define some rules, then, to make it work, we can use any existing programming language to make a program that can understand those rules, which will be our interpreter.</p><h3><strong>Compiler</strong></h3><p>A compiler converts codes into machine code that the processor can execute (e.g. C++ compiler).</p><h3><strong>Interpreter</strong></h3><p>An interpreter goes through the program line by line and executes each command.</p><p>Want to give it a try? Let’s create a super simple programming language together that outputs magenta-colored output in the console. We’ll call it <strong>Magenta</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/s_202E5FF9B61E1911DBB7D9A33C31EAF25C613502CB267B4C9FC3E5DDF63D6AF9_1644233769692_OnPaste.20220207-173602.png?resize=592%2C302&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of terminal output in color magenta.\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/s_202E5FF9B61E1911DBB7D9A33C31EAF25C613502CB267B4C9FC3E5DDF63D6AF9_1644233769692_OnPaste.20220207-173602.png?w=592&amp;ssl=1 592w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/s_202E5FF9B61E1911DBB7D9A33C31EAF25C613502CB267B4C9FC3E5DDF63D6AF9_1644233769692_OnPaste.20220207-173602.png?resize=300%2C153&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"592\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our simple programming language creates a codes variable that contains text that gets printed to the console… in magenta, of course.</p><h3><strong>Setting up our programming language</strong></h3><p>I am going to use Node.js but you can use any language to follow along, the concept will remain the same. Let me start by creating an index.js file and set things up.</p><p>class Magenta { &nbsp;constructor(codes) { &nbsp; &nbsp;this.codes = codes &nbsp;} &nbsp;run() { &nbsp; &nbsp;console.log(this.codes) &nbsp;} } <i>// For now, we are storing codes in a string variable called `codes`</i> <i>// Later, we will read codes from a file</i> const codes = `print \"hello world\" print \"hello again\"` const magenta = new Magenta(codes) magenta.run()</p><p>What we’re doing here is declaring a class called Magenta. That class defines and initiates an object that is responsible for logging text to the console with whatever text we provide it via a codes variable. And, for the time being, we’ve defined that codes variable directly in the file with a couple of “hello” messages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/s_202E5FF9B61E1911DBB7D9A33C31EAF25C613502CB267B4C9FC3E5DDF63D6AF9_1644228498784_OnPaste.20220207-160729.png?resize=556%2C271&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot of terminal output.\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/s_202E5FF9B61E1911DBB7D9A33C31EAF25C613502CB267B4C9FC3E5DDF63D6AF9_1644228498784_OnPaste.20220207-160729.png?w=556&amp;ssl=1 556w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/s_202E5FF9B61E1911DBB7D9A33C31EAF25C613502CB267B4C9FC3E5DDF63D6AF9_1644228498784_OnPaste.20220207-160729.png?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"556\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If we were to run this code we would get the text stored in codes logged in the console.</p><p>OK, now we need to create a what’s called a Lexer.</p>",

We can do this by declaring widths on our flex items. <strong>When we declare a width on a flex item, we throw that intrinsic size out the window, as we’ve now declared an explicit value instead</strong>. This makes figuring out what’s really going on a lot easier.</p><p>In the Pen below, we have a parent that’s a 600px wide flexible container (display: flex). I’ve removed anything that might influence the numbers, so no gap or padding. I’ve also switched out the border for an outline so we can still visualize everything easily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first and third flex items have a width: 300px and the middle one a width: 600px. If we add that all up, it’s a total of 1200px. That’s bigger than the the 600px available within the parent, so flex-shrink kicks in.</p><p>flex-shrink is a ratio. If everything has the same flex-shrink (which is 1 by default), they all shrink at the same rate. <strong>That doesn’t mean they all shrink to the same size or by the same amount</strong>, but they all shrink at the same rate.</p><p>If we jump back into Firefox DevTools, we can see the base size, the flex-shrink and the final size. In this case, the two 300px elements are now 150px, and the 600px one is now 300px.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/s_1892609E7C85427425C71257B0B2EE5E49AECF3D7269C5FAE0F963DD3F719B38_1622215047836_image-1.png?resize=849%2C710&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/s_1892609E7C85427425C71257B0B2EE5E49AECF3D7269C5FAE0F963DD3F719B38_1622215047836_image-1.png?w=849&amp;ssl=1 849w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/s_1892609E7C85427425C71257B0B2EE5E49AECF3D7269C5FAE0F963DD3F719B38_1622215047836_image-1.png?resize=300%2C251&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/s_1892609E7C85427425C71257B0B2EE5E49AECF3D7269C5FAE0F963DD3F719B38_1622215047836_image-1.png?resize=768%2C642&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"849\">The two elements that have a base width of&nbsp;300px&nbsp;become&nbsp;150px.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/s_1892609E7C85427425C71257B0B2EE5E49AECF3D7269C5FAE0F963DD3F719B38_1622215064744_image.png?resize=846%2C698&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/s_1892609E7C85427425C71257B0B2EE5E49AECF3D7269C5FAE0F963DD3F719B38_1622215064744_image.png?w=846&amp;ssl=1 846w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/s_1892609E7C85427425C71257B0B2EE5E49AECF3D7269C5FAE0F963DD3F719B38_1622215064744_image.png?resize=300%2C248&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/s_1892609E7C85427425C71257B0B2EE5E49AECF3D7269C5FAE0F963DD3F719B38_1622215064744_image.png?resize=768%2C634&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"846\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The larger element with a base width of&nbsp;600px&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;300px.</p><p>If we add up all the base sizes of all three flex items (the actual widths we declared on them), the total comes out to 1200px.
